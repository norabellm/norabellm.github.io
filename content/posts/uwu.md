Oh, yeah. The reason I write blog because [these blog post](https://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/03/31/why-i-blog/) is enlighten me. 

A lot information locked in my head, I need a time to rewiring thing to become useable. Doing blogging is assume a nice idea to sorting that thing.

Sharing to create more nerd, I bored talk lone about my shit but I also lazy to socialize. Again, blogging help me spread pre-embriotic nerd to others so they can develop nerdiness.

Getting sponsor, as nerd this quite unrealistic yet capitalistic but by waiting code compiling and tinkering
with nerd thingy is not satisfy empty wallet and pay bill, so again this blog can be my porto for my GitHub Sponsor as self-reward.

I write just because I want. Egoist, huh? Yes, all of my purpose above are to satisfy my self but I do with care to others too.

So, my ultimate goal is:

- Sharing and harnessing idea.
- Preaching computer nerdness.
- Getting sponsored.

That is.
