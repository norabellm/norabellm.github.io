Living off the Land (LotL or LOL, in this we use LOL) might sound like an idea to live deep in to woods with all life resource
rely by nature and at same time get rid any dependence from modern society, like Ted Kaczynski does with
his cabin in Montana wilderness. It sound nice to live like that, day by day just hunting and farming without
worring about bills and another societal consumerism norm. 

This post we not gonna talk about escaping wild bear encounter or erradicate corn plague. We will talk about 
another LOL, especially Living Off the Land Attack using binaries a.k.a LOLbin techniques. 

## Living of The Land Attack

It a form of attack that utillize native and legit software that already exists in the system -- legit is like official app such program that signed by Microsoft which mean that program is theirs.  In non-LOL attack, attack carried by external binaries that contain attack plan. If we using the term from first LOL -- lifestyle context, it like getting fresh fish from river, not crafted and canned at factory. By taking advantage of software that already existing in nature (operating system), the attacker less worry about bug or even dependencies issues that make software less reliable when attacking.

The example of LOL in Windows is like Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), VBA Macro, Powershell, Python (since they will shipper inside MS Office) and any binary on system that have potential abused for malicious task such Downloader (mshta.exe), Persistent (regedit.exe) and many more -- for complete list visit [LOLBAS Project](https://lolbas-project.github.io/). In extreme case, LOL can be use to achive fileless malware attack by using Persistent, fileless attack is type of attack that not "touching" the disk meaning it leave no file.

Another advantage of LOL is the activity by adversaries harder to detect because it use legit tool.

### Lets pratice some attack

This pratice will show you various binary program that used for malcious task. Powershell and other stuff will be for next topic.
